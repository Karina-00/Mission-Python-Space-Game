This folder contains the code, images and sounds for the book Mission Python by Sean McManus

#### 
These files include updates since the first print run of the book. 

These updates are:
Listing 7-5 has a new generate_map() instruction near the end
Listing 8-3 from the first pressing is no longer required
Later listings in chapter 8 have been renumbered (so Listing 8-4 in the first printing is now Listing 8-3 in this download)

You have a first print run if the first instruction after the #START# box on p143 is clock.schedule_interval(...). 
It should be generate_map()
